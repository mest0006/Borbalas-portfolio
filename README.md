i created my web portfolio useing html css and some javascript for the part on my portfolio where i show my work i used grid i did follow and example from w3schools for  one the home page where i show my work. i also used some flex box


i used mainly puprle  for my background color since its my favorite color, i dont think i will use this as my actual portfolio since i know i  can come up with a better design. But the extra time was a really big help!  but i still think if i put more time and effort into it i can make it better  but this was good practice so in the futre when i understand javscript better when i go to creat my actule porfolio i can do better and add more functionalites to it with javascript. 


i  like i have perfected  how to use loops to bring images in through javascripts.
